Force Graph Analyzer
********************************************************************************

**Force Graph Analyzer** is a tool used to render and analyze force graphs.

Builds on the `force-graph`_ projected by vasturiano_.

Another application would need to provide a JSON file in the format used by
**force-graph**.

To run this locally start a local web server like so::

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

Then visit ``http://localhost:8000/index.html``.
